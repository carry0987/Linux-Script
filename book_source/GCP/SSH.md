## Connect GCP With Personal SSH Key
Connecting to an Instance via CLI
You can connect to the instance via CLI in two ways - through `gcloud` commands or through `SSH` commands. Here we will primarily discuss SSH.

### Using Existing Public/Private Keys
Usually, public and private keys are stored in the `~/.ssh` directory. The files will appear in pairs with names `my-ssh-key.pub` and `my-ssh-key`, where `my-ssh-key` could be any filename.
>
>Note: In practice, `my-ssh-key` is by default named `id_rsa` and the server reads `id_rsa` as the key. If you want to use another key file, remember to use the `-i` flag.
>
If you have existing public and private keys in your files, you can directly obtain the public key through 
```bash
cat my-ssh-key.pub
```
and store this public key in the Metadata SSH keys. You can then connect by using the following command
```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/my-ssh-key [USERNAME]@[IP_ADDRESS]
```
This will establish the connection. 

### Generating New Public/Private Keys
You can generate a new pair of public/private keys using the following command:
```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ~/.ssh/my-ssh-key -C [USERNAME]
```
Input a passphrase to protect this pair of keys.

You can restrict access to the key pair to yourself:
```bash
chmod 400 ~/.ssh/my-ssh-key
```
Next, obtain your public key through
```bash
cat ~/.ssh/my-ssh-key.pub
```
Add this key to the Metadata SSH keys and connect via
```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/my-ssh-key [USERNAME]@[IP_ADDRESS]
```

### SSH Command
When we use the SSH command, we connect via
```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/my-ssh-key [USERNAME]@[IP_ADDRESS]
```

>Note2: You can find the `ip_address` in the instance details.

### Checking Whether Your Key is Stored on Google Cloud
If you go to 'Metadata' in the menu now,

and click on the SSH keys, ideally you should see the following interface

This means that Google Compute Engine has stored your key. 
If you hadn't created any instances in this project and made a connection, essentially there would be no key stored. 
You can check the file content in the **`~/.ssh`** directory, and you should see `google_compute_engine.pub` and `google_compute_engine` files. 
These two files represent the public key (pub) and private key generated by Google Cloud for you. 
The one stored on Google Cloud is the public key (`google_compute_engine.pub`).
You can check the content of your public key by typing in the terminal
```bash
cat google_compute_engine.pub
```
The content should be consistent with that stored in the SSH keys section in the Metadata.
